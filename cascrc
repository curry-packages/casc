-- Config file for StyleChecker.
-- Copy this file as .cascrc in your home directory or the directory
-- from where you call casc
--
-- Every line starting with '--' is a comment and will be ignored.
-- The config file contains:
--   * a list of all available checks
--   * an integer for maximum line length
--   * a parameter for the activation of autocorrect

-- You can tell the StyleChecker your desired options by using the numbers 0-2.
--  0:  Don't check this.
--  1:  Check this and show warning messages for violations.
--  2:  Check this and try to correct it automatically.
--     (Available for Expression.IfThenElseKW and Expression.Let.)
